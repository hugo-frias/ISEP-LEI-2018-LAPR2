|| ... saves the user account of this client?  | FacadeAuthorization | IE. The User management is the responsibility of the respective external component whose point of interaction is through the class "AuthorizationFacade" |

## Systematization ##

 From the rational results that the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

 * Company
 * PostalAddress
 * ZipCode
 * Client

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * RegisterClientUI  
 * RegisterClientController
 * ClientsRegistry


**Note:** The responsibility of creating instances of Postal Address was assigned to Client.
However, a client is only valid when he has at least one Postal Address.
In other words, to exist a Client it is necessary to have a Postal Address.
Thus, it is not feasible to ask a Client instance to create a Postal Address.
To resolve this issue the creation of instances of Postal Address is done through a static method in the Client class. Therefore, it is not necessary to have a client instance previously. Other approaches / alternatives are possible.
