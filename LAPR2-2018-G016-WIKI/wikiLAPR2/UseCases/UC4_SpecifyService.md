# UC4 - Specify Service

## Brief Format

The administrative starts to specify a new service. The system requests all the necessary data (i.e. service type, the id, a brief and complete description, the service category and the hourly cost). The administrative enters the necessary data. The system validates the data and show them to the administrative, asking him to confirm them. The administrative confirms. The system records the data and notifies the administrative.

*a. The administrative wants to cancel the service specification.

> The use case ends.

2a. There aren't any types of service defined in the system.
> 1. The system warns the administritive for that. The use case ends.

6a. There aren't any categories defined in the system.
>   1. The system warns the administritive for that.
>   2. The system allows the creation of a new category (UC3).
> > 2a. O administrativo nÃ£o cria uma categoria. O caso de uso termina.
