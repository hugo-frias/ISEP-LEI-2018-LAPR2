# Laboratory/Project 2 ‚Äì Project Assignment

**1. Goals**
In this project, students should be able to apply concepts of analysis, modelling and objectoriented programming to develop a Java application to manage services requests from clients and
the activity of service providers. In compliance with good practices learned and applied during the
first part of the semester, on the course units Software Engineering (ESOFT), Programming
Paradigms (PPROG), Discrete Mathematics (MDISC), Computational Mathematics (MATCP) and
Lab/Project 2 (LAPR2), an iterative and incremental development process is used. The main core of
the software should be implemented in Java. To increase the maintainability of the software
analysis best practices, Object-Oriented (OO) software design must be adopted and
implementation should follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. Technical
documentation must be produced during the project.

**2. Project Description**
The project that will be developed in this course is the continuation of the project started in the
Software Engineering course (ESOFT). In ESOFT the students developed an application to manage
services requests from clients and the activity of companies dedicated to providing these services.
In LAPR2 course the students will start by implementing the application developed in ESOFT
(called AGPSD). The students should update all artifacts generated during the software
development process and code all the application in Java programming language.
Additionally, in LAPR2 course the students will implement a set of scheduling algorithms, add
some functionalities to the AGPSD application and will implement a new application that will be
used by the Service Provider.
Methods that are used to send e-mails will not be implemented by the students.

**2.1 Extensions to the AGPSD application**
After each service has been executed, the Service Provider (SP) should use the AGPSD application
to report the end of the work. The SP should see the details of the service and should evaluate
how the service ran. If the service was executed as stipulated, the SP only acknowledges the end
of the service. In cases where something unexpected happened the SP should introduce a
description reporting the issue and troubleshooting strategy. At any time, the client should use the
AGPSD application to rate the service (scale is 0 - 5) and see the invoice.
The Human Resources Officer (HRO) should use the system to evaluate the SP. The HRO should
see charts (a histogram showing SP rating distribution) and statistics showing the performance of
each SP. Among these statistics, the application should compute: the mean and standard deviation 
of the ratings given to each SP and to all SPs; the absolute differences (deviation) between the
average ratings of each service provider and the mean rating of all service providers; using the
population mean rating, for each provider the application should label as ‚ÄúWorst Providers‚Äù,
‚ÄúRegular Providers‚Äù and ‚ÄúOutstanding Providers‚Äù, all providers whose mean is, respectively, less
than ùúá ‚àí ùúé, between ùúá ‚àí ùúé and ùúá + ùúé, and above ùúá + ùúé. Here ùúá represents the population mean
and ùúé is the standard deviation. After seeing these statistics the HRO should accept or change the
labels given to each SP.
The mean rating and the classification (label) of each SP should be seen by the client every time
the scheduling algorithm assigns a SP to a service requested by the client.
The AGPSD application should include two algorithms for job scheduling: First-Come First-Served
and Random Scheduling. The SP that will be scheduled to do the service will be selected using,
firstly, the SP rating, secondly, the distance from the client.
The external service used to Specify the Geographical Area (UC5) should be implemented using
geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each zip code. The latitude and longitude of
each zip code will be provided as a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file (resource available in
Moodle). To reduce the computational complexity (memory and run-time) and easy the
implementation and testing, only a subset of zip codes corresponding to Porto region will be used
in this work.

**2.2 Service Provider Application**
The Service Provider will have an application to see the service execution orders. Therefore, this
application should include a functionality to import execution orders. Moreover, this application
should allow the SP to see and sort records by any field describing the service execution orders
(name of the client, distance from SP facilities to client‚Äôs home, service category, service start date
and time, type of service and client‚Äôs address). Moreover, the application should allow the SP to
see the historical (timeline) of services for each client.

**2.3 Non-functional requirements**
The software development process should be iterative and incremental while adopting good
design practices and coding standards. The students should use the software development process
introduced in ESOFT.
All the algorithms implemented in this work should be highly efficient.
Both applications should be implemented in Java and the user interface should be implemented
using JavaFX, a Java library used to build Rich Internet Applications.
The implementation process must follow a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach. Unit tests
should be developed to validate all domain classes. Code changes must follow the same criteria,
i.e. when changing existing components, unit tests must be developed or updated. When
developing Input/Output (IO) methods for files, unit tests are recommended but not mandatory
under the LAPR2 project. The final evaluation of the project will include an analysis of the quality 
of testing and the use of a test-driven development approach. Code coverage and mutation
coverage is based on unit testing and is performed using quality assurance tools.
In this project all members of the team should use Jenkins and Sonar Cube for continuous
integration and code quality assessment, respectively. For task and issue management the team
should use Trello.

**3. Deliverables**
This section describes all the deliverables necessary for the project. Failure to comply with these
may invalidate proper assessment of the project.
Your project should always be up to date on Bitbucket. The version that will be assessed is the one
with the commit time closest to the deadline. Nevertheless, all team members should submit the
following files on Moodle. At the end of the project (June 16, 11.55 p.m.), students must submit on
LAPR2‚Äôs Moodle a final delivery that should contain the following zip files:
1. Project‚Äôs Wiki, in a single ZIP file, named LAPR2-YYYY-GXXX-WIKI .zip containing technical
documentation;
2. The Project Report, named LAPR2-YYYY-GXXX-Report.pdf;
3. The project repository (all folders in the repository), in a single ZIP file named LAPR2-YYYYGXXX-Application.zip.

**4. Assessment**
Assessment is performed everyday while students are in class and receive immediate feedback
and through a final project assessment. Therefore, class attendance is mandatory.

**4.1 Class Assessment**
Each class is assessed by the teacher in the classroom. Such assessment is based on the students‚Äô
attendance to class and their performance. Class attendance of students with worker-student
status will not be considered in the assessment.

**4.2 Commit Messages**
Git commit messages should include a description, a keyword and the task/issue number.
Examples:
‚Ä¢ [Unit Testing] - commit introduces changes to Unit Testing
‚Ä¢ [Implementation] - commit introduces changes to Implementation
‚Ä¢ [UC-XX] - commit introduces changes to a Use Case XX
‚Ä¢ [fixes issue #YY] - commit is associated to Trello Issue YY
Example commit message: ‚ÄúAdd class Exhibition [UC-01] [Implementation] [fixes issue #10].‚Äù 

**4.3 Plagiarism**
Any attempt of copy or plagiarism (using third-party code) not explicitly mentioned in the report,
will be heavily penalized and may lead to project annulment. Failure to comply with these policies
and procedures will result in disciplinary action.
